# Development products

-   The [PISCO_HyM_GR2M](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PISCO_HyM_GR2M_v1_1/14382758) product is a data set of monthly flows throughout the Peruvian territory, simulated using the GR2M model. It contains time series of mean monthly flows from January 1981 to March 2020.

-   The [PISCO_HyD_ARNOVIC](#0) product is a data set of daily flows throughout the Peruvian territory, simulated using the ARNOVIC model. This product contains time series of mean daily flows from 1981-01-01 to 2022-12-31.

-   The [SONICS](#0) product has been developed for monitoring and forecasting fluvial floods in Peru. This system provides continuous updates on the current state of 12,000 river reaches nationwide, and forecasts for a 7-day horizon.

# R packages

-   [RClimChange](https://github.com/hllauca/RClimChange) is a package developed for downloading and subsetting data from Global Climate Models (GCM) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). The data is extracted from *NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections* (NEX-GDDP, <https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp-cmip6>).

    `devtools::install_github("hllauca/RClimChange")`

    `library(RClimChange)`

-   [GR2MSemiDistr](https://github.com/hllauca/GR2MSemiDistr) is a package for the execution of the GR2M conceptual model at a semi-distributed level (by sub-basins) in large domains. This package processes the PISCO forcing data at the sub-basin level, identifies the optimal set of model parameters using the Shuffle Complex Evolutionary (SCE) algorithm, and routes monthly flows to the outlet of each sub-basin using the Weighted Flow Accumulation (WFAC) algorithm.
