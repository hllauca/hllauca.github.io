-   The [SONICS](https://harold-llauca.shinyapps.io/sonics/) dashboard has been developed for monitoring and forecasting fluvial floods in Peru. This system provides continuous updates on the current state of 12 thousand river reaches nationwide, and forecasts for a 7-day horizon.

# R packages

-   [GR2MSemiDistr](https://github.com/hllauca/GR2MSemiDistr) is a package for the execution of the GR2M conceptual model at a semi-distributed level (by sub-basins) in large domains. This package processes the PISCO forcing data at the sub-basin level, identifies the optimal set of model parameters using the Shuffle Complex Evolutionary (SCE) algorithm, and routes monthly flows to the outlet of each sub-basin using the Weighted Flow Accumulation (WFAC) algorithm.
