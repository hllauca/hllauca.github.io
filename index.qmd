## Welcome!

Thanks for visiting my website. I am a professional in water resources with experience in the analysis and modeling of hydrological processes, development of short- and long-term streamflow forecasts, runoff prediction in ungauged basins, satellite precipitation products' applications, climate change impacts on catchment hydrology, and hydroinformatic applications.

My recent work is focused on developing new climate services that support the detection and prediction of extreme hydrological hazards in Peru.
