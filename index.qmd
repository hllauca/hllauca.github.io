## Welcome!

Thanks for visit my personal website. I am a professional in water resources with experience in the analysis and modeling of hydrological processes, development of short- and long-term streamflow forecasts, runoff prediction in ungauged basins, satellite precipitation products' applications, climate change impacts on catchment hydrology, and hydroinformatic applications.

My recent work are focused on develop new climate services that support detection and prediction of extreme hydrological hazards in Peru.
